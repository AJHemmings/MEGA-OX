# Mega OX – Future Full-Stack Noughts & Crosses Game

## Description
**Mega OX** is an innovative twist on the classic Noughts and Crosses (Tic-Tac-Toe) game, where each player's move is dictated by the previous player's move. This dynamic approach creates a fresh challenge for every game, making it a unique and engaging experience for all players.

### Key Features:
- **Unique Game Mechanics**: Each player’s move depends on the previous player’s move, creating unpredictable gameplay.
- **Object-Oriented JavaScript**: Transitioning from traditional JavaScript to object-oriented JavaScript to enhance code structure and maintainability.
- **Responsive Design**: The game is built to be played across different devices, ensuring a smooth user experience.

## Future Scope
The goal is to transition Mega OX into a **full-stack application**, incorporating the following features:
- **Full Stack**: Developing the back-end using Node.js and integrating it with the front-end.
- **Database Integration**: Storing user profiles, game history, and settings in a database to offer a persistent experience across sessions.
- **Customization Features**: Allowing players to customize their experience, such as choosing game themes, avatars, and move styles.
- **User Profiles**: Enabling users to create accounts, track their performance, and save progress.

## Technologies Used
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: For game logic and player interaction.
- **HTML5/CSS3**: For game interface and responsive design.
- **Node.js** (Future Scope): For server-side functionality.
- **MongoDB/SQL** (Future Scope): For database integration.
